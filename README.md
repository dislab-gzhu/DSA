# DSA
This is pytorch repository of "DSA: Dual-scale Stochastic Augmentation for Boosting the Transferability of Adversarial Examples"

Note that,  core functions will be updated once the paper has been accepted for publication.

# Adversarial Process
1: download data into 'input_dir',

2: download the pre-trained models' checkpoints to 'model_path',

3: run main.py to generate adversaial examples

5: evaluate the generated samples in the 'output_dir' folder
